# TweakScale :: Breaking Parts

On Release [2.4.3](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/179030-14-tweakscale-under-lisias-management-2430-2019-0608/page/16/&tab=comments#comment-3614866) a new Sanity Check intended to prevent yet another [issue](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScale/issues/34) .

It was found that the game was being plagued by this problem from some time now as a lot of reports were issued due the Alert Message Box triggered when such problems are detected.

A unhappy side effect after fixing the problems is that current savegames are kind of addicted to the broken parts, and living parts lose the correct scaling settings, with nasty effects.

A workaound is to break the parts again :P but this time, on purpose and in a safe way. On the [`Extras` folder](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScale/tree/master/Extras) from the Distribution zip you will find a subfolder called `BreakingParts` with patches that you can copy here and salvage your current gaming. It's advised to copy only the patches needed to fix your savegame.

Keep in mind that by using these patches, your crafts are not compatible to mainstream anymore, as the canonical releases have the patches fixed from now.
