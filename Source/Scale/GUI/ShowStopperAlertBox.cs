The KSP.log is listing every compromised part(s) on your installment, look for lines with '[TweakScale] ERROR: **FATAL**' on the log line. Be aware that the parts being reported are not the culprits, but the Screaming Victims.

There's no possible automated fix for the problem, your best line of action is to call for help on Forum by clicking on the OK button below. We will help you on diagnosing the Add'On that is troubling you. Publish your KSP.log on some file share service and mention it on the post.

Be advised that by not closing KSP right now, your savegames can get corrupted at any time, even when things appear to work by now - and the salvage can be harder.

Backup everything *NOW* if you choose to ignore this message and proceed - TweakScale recommends S.A.V.E. to automate this task for you.";
